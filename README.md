# Deploy Bicep

This action deploys a Bicep deployment or a Deployment Stack based on a deployment file. This can be either a `.bicepparam` or a `.bicep` file.
It supports the use of the `deploymentconfig.json` or `deploymentconfig.jsonc` file for advanced deployment options.

## Scenarios

This action supports a few scenarios:

### Parameter file per environment

This is the most common scenario.

For this scenario, the only thing you require is a directory for the deployment and a `.bicepparam` file with the same name as the GitHub environment to use for the deployment.
The action should then use the `.bicepparam` file for the `deployment-file-path` parameter.

In the following example, the dev and prod environments will use different parameter files for deployments, while using the same `main.bicep` template file.

```
<repo root>
  - bicep-deployments
    - <deployment name>
      - main.bicep
      - dev.bicepparam
      - prod.bicepparam
```

### Bicep file per environment

Sometimes, especially when consuming public Bicep modules, it can become complex and cumbersome to ensure parameters are passed correctly through a `*.bicep` template consuming the modules to the respective `*.bicepparam` files.
In this case, it can make sense to use `.bicep` template files directly as if they were parameter files and just hard-code the sub-module parameters.
While this can be counter-intuitive, this can be a good practice as the modules you are deploying are not reusable.
This is especially valid in scenarios where you use a `subscription` scoped deployment for managing the resource groups and consuming [Azure Verified Modules (AVM)](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules) for the resources.

This scenario is supported in this action by referring the `deployment-file-path` parameter directly to the `.bicep` file. In this scenario, the `.bicep` file must be named according to the GitHub environment to use for the deployment.

For example:

```
<repo root>
  - bicep-deployments
    - <deployment name>
      - dev.bicep
      - prod.bicep
```

### With configuration options

Sometimes there is a need to specify additional properties or parameters for a deployment that cannot be specified through the `.bicep` or `.bicepparam` files directly. For these scenarios, the action supports one or multiple `deploymentconfig.json` files.

You can use a single `deploymentconfig.json` that will apply to all the deployments and environments in the deployment directory, **or** you can use individual `deploymentconfig.json` files per environment.

> [!TIP]
> The `deploymentconfig.json` file supports comments if you use the `.jsonc` extension.

> [!WARNING]
> In the case of conflicting `.json` and `.jsonc` files, the `.jsonc` takes precedence.

The most common reason for this is to alter the deployment scope for a deployment. By default, all deployments will be treated as `subscription` scoped deployments. If deploying directly to a resource group for example, you need to specify the resource group name in the `deploymentconfig.json` file. See the chapter for the `deploymentconfig.json` options for more information.

Example showing a single `deploymentconfig.json file` that will apply to all environment deployments.

```
<repo root>
  - bicep-deployments
    - <deployment name>
      - deploymentconfig.json
      - main.bicep
      - dev.bicepparam
      - prod.bicepparam
```

Example showing multiple `deploymentconfig.json` files that will be applied individually to each environment deployment.

```
<repo root>
  - bicep-deployments
    - <deployment name>
      - main.bicep
      - dev.deploymentconfig.json
      - dev.bicepparam
      - prod.deploymentconfig.json
      - prod.bicepparam
```

> [!TIP]
> You can mix and match these. Having a common _fallback_ file and an individual file for one or more of the environment deployments.

> [!WARNING]
> If you have multiple `deploymentconfig.json` files, they will not be merged. The most specific file will apply exclusively.

### Bicep param files per environment using only public/external modules

The action supports deployments using `.bicepparam` files directly referencing Bicep registry modules. In that case, you do not need to have a `.bicep` file.

A common scenario for this is when deploying an [Azure Verified Modules (AVM)](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules) directly to a pre-existing resource group.

### Deployment Stacks

Azure now supports deployment stacks to manage the lifecycle of complex deployments.

This is supported in this action as well by using the `.deploymentconfig.json` file.

## Deployment Config options

Sometimes there is a need to specify additional properties or parameters for a deployment that cannot be specified through the `.bicep` or `.bicepparam` files directly. For these scenarios, the action supports one or multiple `deploymentconfig.json` files.

You can use a single `deploymentconfig.json` that will apply to all the deployments and environments in the deployment directory, **or** you can use individual `deploymentconfig.json` files per environment.

See [With configuration options](#with-configuration-options) for more information on the structure.

When creating a `deploymentconfig.json` or `deploymentconfig.jsonc` file, you should start with a schema reference to get proper schema validation and auto-complete options.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-climpr/schemas/refs/heads/main/schemas/v1.0.0/bicep-deployment/deploymentconfig.json#"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The denySettings object is required, even if no properties are specified.

> [!WARNING]
> If specifying `excludedPrincipals`, remember to add the Id of the deployment principal. Otherwise, the deployment will fail as the deployment principal is locked out itself.
> If the option is not specified, the deployment principal is added by default.

## How to use this action

This action can be used multiple ways.

- Single deployments
- Part of a dynamic, multi-deployment strategy using the `matrix` capabilities in Github.
- Part of a pull request event to plan changes using the `what-if: "true"` parameter.

It requires the repository to be checked out before use, and that the Github runner is logged in to the respective Azure environment.

It is called as a step like this:

```yaml
# ...
steps:
  - name: Checkout repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v6

  - name: Azure login via OIDC
    uses: azure/login@v3
    with:
      client-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
      tenant-id: ${{ vars.TENANT_ID }}
      subscription-id: ${{ vars.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

  - name: Run Bicep deployments
    id: deploy-bicep
    uses: open-climpr/deploy-bicep@v1
    with:
      deployment-file-path: <Path to .bicepparam file>
      what-if: "false"
# ...
```

## Examples:
